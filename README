This is a set of configuration files for a bunch of Unix apps I use regularly.

The way I usually use this is as follows. Change the lines as appropriate for
your system.

Change into the cloned repositry and run setup.sh:
    $ cd rc_files
    $ bash setup.sh

This will link all the configuration files into your home directory. It is therefore required
to keep the cloned repositry.

You're done now. You probably want to restore your ssh keys (backed up to ~/backup) back into ~/.ssh

Create files in ~/.bash called environment_local, interactive_local, etc to
do this.
